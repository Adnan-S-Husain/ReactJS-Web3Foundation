# React-Web3Foundations

Link to the live web application => (https://react-web3funds.web.app) \
A Frontend, React based Web-application.\
It is another one of my free lancing projects which displays information about Grants provided by Web3Foundation team.\
Some of the features:

1. The application includes a search bar and very complex filtering options for hundreds of data of granted applications.
2. It is completely responsive i.e. mobile friendly.
3. Fully animated using javascript libraries such as AOS and Framer Motion.
4. It uses data scraped by using Javascript library Puppeteer in Node js.
5. All of the styling is done in Sass.

This project tested all of my React knowledge. Had a lot of fun making this project come to life and learned alot.\
